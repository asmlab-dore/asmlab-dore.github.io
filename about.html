<p class="p1"> <b> Understanding how ideas, emotions, and behaviors spread, using tools from marketing, psychology, and neuroscience.</b> Research in the Affective Science of Marketing lab examines social influence, emotion, and persuasive communication. Our work combines large online observational studies and experiments with functional neuroimaging and natural language processing techniques that give insight into underlying mechanisms. Currently active lines of work focus on 1) understanding the spread of emotions through social networks, and 2) building predictive models of effective health messaging
on the basis of objective and subjective measures, with particular emphasis on what makes mental health messaging effective.</p>
