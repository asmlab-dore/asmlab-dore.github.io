<p class="p1"> Research in the Affective Science of Marketing lab examines social influence, emotion, and the spread of ideas. This work combines large-scale observational studies and experiments with functional neuroimaging and natural language processing techniques that give insight into underlying mechanisms. Current lines of work focus on predicting the success of persuasive messages 
  using behavioural and brain data, with particular emphasis on what makes health messaging and healthcare service advertising effective.</span></p>
