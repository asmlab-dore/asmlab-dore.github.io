<p class="p1"> <b> Understanding how ideas and emotions spread, using tools from marketing, psychology, and neuroscience.</b> Research in the Affective Science of Marketing lab examines social influence, emotion, and persuasive communication. Our work combines large online behavioral studies with functional neuroimaging and natural language processing techniques that give insight into underlying mechanisms. Current projects focus on: why emotions spread rapidly through social networks, what makes mental health imaging effective, and how social contexts shape word-of-mouth.</p>
